% Wavelet demos
%
%
% wmenu     - main menu to all the wavelet demos
%
% Graphing:
%     wavdemo   - wavelets in 1D
%     wav2demo  - wavelets in 2D
%     wpdemo    - wavelet packets in 1D
%     wp2demo   - wavelet packets in 2D
%
% Wavelet packets:
%     wpsig     - signal analysis using wavelet packets
%     chrpdemo  - analysis of several different 'chirps' with wavelet packets
%     chrpcomp  - comparison of wavelets, wavelet packets, and FFT 
%
% Operators:
%     wavoperd  - representations of operators in wavelet bases
%     wpoperd   - representations of operators in wavelet packet bases
%     wavmultd  - fast matrix multiplication using wavelets
%
% Image processing:
%     imgdemo   - a very simple image processing demo
%
%
% These functions may be of independent interest:
%     nsexampl  - some non-standard example matrices and operators
%     afun      - used by nsexampl
%     hfun      - used by nsexampl
% 
%     comscale  - scales three matrices to have entries between 0 and 1
%     varfwt2   - a variation of fwt2ns for demonstration purposes
